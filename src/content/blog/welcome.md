# Welcome to My New Blog

I'm excited to launch my new blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)! 

## Why Astro?

Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. It offers:

- **Component Islands** - A new web architecture for building faster websites
- **Server-First API Design** - Astro moves expensive rendering off of your users' devices
- **Zero JS, by Default** - No JavaScript runtime overhead to slow you down
- **Edge-Ready** - Deploy anywhere, even to the global edge

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology, development, and more. Stay tuned!

Feel free to [check out the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/thomasmagee/thomasmagee.github.io) to see how this blog is built.
